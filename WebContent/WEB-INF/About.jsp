			<h2>About Personal Paste</h2>

			<p>
				This application was developed by myself, Philip Rodriguez, in literally about
				5 hours in 2017. That might seem like a lot even consider how seriously basic
				this webapp is, but this is also my first ever webapp. Literally. This is the
				first website or web application I have ever built. I've messed with HTML before,
				but I was always "clueless" as to how interactive webapps with dynamic content
				were made. I mean, I understood that my web browser sent a request off to some
				server and that server did some backend magic to generate me a personalized html
				page on the fly, but I'd never used the technologies that do that backend magic.
				Now, I can say that I indeed have used the backend magic, I have touched the cool
				html generating thing! Also, I love Java as a language so of course I went with
				Java as the backend thing I wanted to use. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Webapps have always seemed really cool to me in the sense that they immediately 
				(for the most part) work on any and every device with no need to install even as
				much as a JVM or Python interpreter. I mean, I guess you need a web browser, which
				is essentially like having an interpreter installed, but hey everyone already has
				a web browser so it's still wonderful! Maybe I'll actually make meaningful webapps
				in the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyways, I don't really know why you read all of this about for such a simple
				project. I'm sure this project has some little things about it that would make
				more experienced webapp developers cringe, but hey you have to start somewhere,
				right? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Yeah, this webapp really is almost useless because pastebin is already a thing,
				but I thought it made a good quick HTML/Spring MVC exercise project.
